                            - Shortness of Breath (Dyspnea):
                            Iron: Iron deficiency anemia can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells, causing dyspnea.
                            Vitamin B12 and Folate: Deficiencies in these vitamins can affect red blood cell production and oxygen transport, contributing to dyspnea.
                            
                            - Sleep Disorders:
                            Magnesium: Insufficient magnesium levels may interfere with sleep regulation and quality.
                            Vitamin D: Deficiency in vitamin D has been associated with sleep disorders, including insomnia.
                            
                            - Bronchodilator Effects:
                            Vitamin C: Adequate vitamin C levels are crucial for lung function and may support bronchodilation.
                            Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in fish oils, these fats have anti-inflammatory effects that can support respiratory function.
                            
                            - Temperature Perception Variability:
                            Thyroid Hormones (Iodine, Selenium): Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism and body temperature. Deficiencies in iodine or selenium can affect thyroid function, leading to temperature perception issues.
                            Vitamin D: Adequate levels of vitamin D are essential for overall metabolic health, potentially impacting temperature regulation.
